NEMS Linux 1.5 Changelogs
=========================

The NEMS 1.5 release cycle will focus on an enhanced user experience and
documentation.

On September 22, 2019, NEMS Linux 1.5.1 was released.

NEMS Linux 1.5.2 was released June 1, 2020, introducing support for the
Raspberry Pi 4B 8GB SBC.

**Key Development Features and Goals:**

-  Nagios upgraded to latest current core.
-  HTML email notifications.
-  Admin contacted if NEMS is offline (via API check-in).
-  New plugins and check_commands integrated based on community
   requests.
-  Documentation at the checkcommands level improved, along with other
   step-by-step guides added to the documentation.
-  Bring support for industrial PCs such as the CL100 and FitLet2.
-  Create a Virtual Appliance.
-  Upgrade base to Debian Buster.
-  Upgrade PHP to 7.3.

Big thanks also to Heini Holm Andersen for granting me special
permission to use, customize and distribute `Nagios Responsive HTML
Email Notifications Templates`_ as part of NEMS 1.5+.

Also, thanks to `Björn Ricks`_ from `Greenbone Networks`_ for kindly
providing a much more current version of WMI after OpenVAS stopped
supporting it. This new version has become `nems-wmic`_ and is
integrated into NEMS Linux 1.5.

**Known Issues**

-  While I had wanted to include a pre-configured CSF/LFD firewall with
   the release of NEMS Linux 1.5, unfortunately it didn't make it in on
   time: CSF/LFD is not yet compatible with Debian Buster, and so has
   been moved to NEMS Linux 1.6.
-  IMPI check commands will not function yet due to `a bug in
   FreeIPMI`_. The check commands are already in place, so I will push
   this out as an update as soon as it is fixed upstream. Until this
   time, FreeIMPI and its components have been removed from NEMS Linux.

**NEMS 1.5 Changelog**

.. Tip:: This changelog is a list of the major
  revisions culminated during this NEMS release cycle. To see the full
  list of Git commits, please also check out `the web site`_.

**Initial Release**

-  MSSQL check as per `itsubs@sagroup.co.uk`_.
-  check_docker and check_docker_swarm from
   https://github.com/timdaman/check_docker `as per Zerant`_.

**New Features**

-  **NEMS Cloud Services** - NEMS 1.5 introduces NEMS Cloud Services. By
   activating this optional service, your NEMS Linux server will benefit
   from off-site backups and notifications should your device stop
   responding (See NEMS CheckIn below). Plus, later this year I will be
   introducing a web-based tactical view that is accessible from
   anywhere, and amalgamates the tactical information of multiple NEMS
   servers on your account allowing sysadmins a method of monitoring
   multiple sites from one cloud-based dashboard.
-  **NEMS CheckIn** - NEMS 1.5 introduces `NEMS CheckIn`_. CheckIn will
   notify you by email if your NEMS Linux server becomes unresponsive.
   Disabled by default, NEMS CheckIn can be configured within NEMS SST.
   This service requires a NEMS Cloud Services account.
-  **Optional TLS** - TLS Secure Authentication can be disabled in NEMS
   SST for SMTP email `as requested by luckyworlock`_.
-  **Graphing** - nagiosgraphs now comes preinstalled `as requested by
   Erast Fondorin`_. It is configured and functional in Nagios Core, but
   can also be accessed from the NEMS Dashboard *Reporting* menu.
-  **Webhook Notifications** - NEMS Linux now supports notifications via
   webhook as requested by `Jon Backhaus`_. This feature was added to
   `nems-tools: Warning Light`_.
-  **Custom Appearance** - NEMS SST now features the ability to change
   the background on some NEMS screens.

   -  Background Selection, allows you to select from the following:

      -  *Daily Image (Default)* option loads a new image every day.
      -  *NEMS Legacy* shows the classic server room image from NEMS
         Linux 1.4.
      -  *Custom Color* allows you to choose a base color to use for the
         background.
      -  *Upload Image* allows you to upload your own preferred
         wallpaper image.

   -  Blur Background Selection, allows you to add a blur effect to
      background images:

      -  *Slight Blur* will add a subtle Gaussian blur to the background
         image.
      -  *Medium Blur* will add a more pronounced blur to the background
         image.
      -  *Heavy Blur* will blur the background image so heavily that
         only the color scheme of the image is recognizable.

**Bug Fixes**

-  WiFi now works on Raspberry Pi devices out of the box `as reported by
   the community`_.
-  `check_sbc_temperature`_ (previously called *check_rpi_temperature*)
   prompts for Warning and Critical temperatures as pointed out by
   `mgl1976`_.
-  Fixed Nagios Core *Trends* and *Alert Histogram* giving 404 errors as
   per `damo`_.
-  Fixed *Host Detail* and *Service detail* giving 404 error as per
   `ronjtaylor`_.
-  There was a `known issue with Monit 5.20`_ (included in NEMS 1.4.1)
   which results in an error "Forbidden: Invalid CSRF Token". For
   Monit's web interface to work, you must open it in an Incognito
   window (the bug is related to cookies). A fix was rolled into NEMS
   Linux upstream (as of October 2018). 5.25 is out in source, but not
   in Debian repositories. As this bug was fixed, I'm no longer
   concerned about the issue, though it will be nice to see 5.25 make
   its way into the repos.
-  DST problem in Nagvis `as per ronjohntaylor`_ fixed by system-wide
   timezone variables now being set in *nems-init*.
-  `check_nrpe`_ is now installed to the correct folder. The upstream
   installer places it in the folder for Nagios 3, not Nagios 4.

**Improved Features**

-  Email notifications are now responsive HTML emails. Please see the
   "thanks" section above.
-  NEMS SST now allows you to disable rolling updates. By doing so, your
   deployment will remain as is, allowing you to better control when/if
   your NEMS server is updated. As suggested by Dave Harman. Also
   supports putting off updates to run once per month, once per week, or
   once every two weeks as requested by John Naab.
-  All check_wmi_plus check commands have been redone to correct the
   argument counts and also to provide better descriptions for each arg.
   Was suggested by mydogboris.

**Miscellaneous**

-  samba shares have been improved to support long filenames.
-  MOTD has been improved. The generally not useful info has been
   removed making it a little cleaner looking, and a new ASCII logo has
   been integrated.

-  Removed the old default checks from NEMS host and created new
   templates specifically for NEMS that are more appropriate for
   low-powered SBCs (super high CPU load thresholds, for example). Some
   users were running the sample checks as if they were intended for
   production use rather than as a guide, so this should help those
   users by not setting off irrelevant alerts such as CPU load or swap
   usage on the NEMS server (particularly problematic on low powered
   devices like Raspberry Pi, since the default samples are more suited
   for monitoring full-powered Linux servers). `Reported by
   experimenter`_, MarshMan, and others.
-  NEMS SST now warns you if you try to navigate away before saving
   changes.
-  WMIC is no longer being distributed by OpenVAS, so I have forked the
   most current git repo their parent company provided, and am now using
   that (after some modifications). New active repository is located at
   https://github.com/Cat5TV/wmic and *wmic* version has been upgraded
   from 1.3.14 to 4.0.0.
-  *vim* is now included by default `as requested by Zerant`_.
-  *webmin* has been removed from NEMS Linux. The networking feature
   `has been broken for quite some time`_, and waiting for the patches
   to arrive upstream has been much too long. Also, Webmin tends to
   confuse novice users into thinking their NEMS server is out of date
   (due to pending OS updates), and in some rare cases has resulted in
   users breaking their configuration. There are no reasons to keep
   Webmin, but many to remove it.

**Rolling Updates 1.5**

February 2019

-  Moved bootscreen to TTY7 and disabled kernel log
   output. TTY1 (the previous default) was also receiving syslog
   messages, which led to a messy screen. As noted by Bill Marshall.
-  Raspberry Pi 2/3 Build 1 private Patron release.
-  ODROID XU4 Build 2 private Patron release. Fixes
   WMIC compile issue. Updated versions of PHP, Apache2, and a few other
   packages that were updated upstream.
-  Fixed ownership of *nems-www*, which was causing
   users to be unable to upload custom backgrounds. Reported by Haaku.
   Thanks to m9Networks and UltimateBugHunter for assisting.
-  Fixed environment variables for local libraries
   to ensure *wmic* can find *libopenvas_wmiclient.so.1*. Also improved
   the *nems-wmic* installation procedure to ensure all files are saved
   and persistent. This to mydogboris for testing.
-  Removed NEMS Linux version number from header of
   NEMS Dashboard. As it is already included in the footer, it is
   redundant.
-  Removed Facebook link from NEMS Dashboard (I have
   been using it less and less) and changed the YouTube and Twitter
   links to point to the new NEMS Linux profiles, rather than my
   personal profiles. NEMS has its own now!
-  ODROID XU4 Build 3 private Patron release. Merges
   all rolling updates. Fixes *wmic*.
-  Network Manager was using its default setting to
   automatically spoof a new MAC address every time wifi connected. On a
   Raspberry Pi using WiFi, this would cause a new IP address in the
   DHCP pool, and users trying to establish static reservations would
   not be able to do so. I over-wrote the default and now the actual
   physical MAC address will be used. The patch will future-ready all
   other NEMS builds for devices that support WiFi.
-  Raspberry Pi devices now resize the filesystem on
   boot, rather than on init.
-  Raspberry Pi 2/3 Build 2 private Patron release.
   Merges all rolling updates. Re-compiled *wmic* and applied WiFi
   patch. Added US locale out of the box.
-  Moved Raspberry Pi to stable kernel rather than
   latest kernel.
-  ODROID XU4 Build 3 Public release.
-  Opened ports 548,5353,5354 in CSF/LFD Firewall to
   allow AVAHI / mDNS to function normally, as per issue reported by Jon
   Backhaus. Will have no effect on NEMS Linux 1.5 since CSF/LFD are not
   yet compatible.
-  Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+ added. Raspberry Pi Model
   B/B+ have been split so the correct board will be reported (B or B+,
   not B/B+).
-  *nems-update* output improved. Formatting
   improved, and now includes the before and after git commit IDs.
-  Fixed NEMS 1.5 using NEMS 1.4 database out of the
   box before initialization.
-  Set default timezone to America/Toronto.
-  Ensure packages are not upgraded from Sury's PHP
   repository on Raspberry Pi Zero/1 (breaks these builds if otherwise).
-  Added *piwatcher* switch to `nems-info`_.
   `piWatcher`_ support is now fully integrated and will automatically
   power cycle a Raspberry Pi-based NEMS Linux server if it becomes
   unresponsive.
-  NEMS Linux 1.5 base upgraded to Debian Buster.
   This resolves many backport issues on the Raspberry Pi Zero/1 build,
   and further upgrades many of the underlying core OS components.
-  PHP upgraded to 7.3.
-  CSF/LFD firewall not yet compatible with Debian
   Buster. Removed until such time as it is.
-  Move JavaScript and CSS assets from CDNJS to
   *nems-www*. Users with certain DNS filters were missing components
   such as jQuery due to CDNJS being blocked by their DNS provider.
-  Released Build 3 for Raspberry Pi to Patrons.
   This test release merges all Raspberry Pi boards into a single build
   and is for testing only (not for production use).
-  Write a new installer for *raspi-config* on
   Raspberry Pi build. Build 3 failed to install it, so automated
   filesystem resize failed on first boot and WiFi settings could not be
   configured.
-  Build 4 for Raspberry Pi released to Patrons.
   This is a test build that resizes correctly on first boot and
   supports WiFi. However it does not have the check_commands compiled
   so is not ready for production use.
-  Removed *nagios-plugins* which appears to be a
   dead project (still no 2.2.2 after all these years, doesn't compile
   correctly on buster) and moved to *monitoring-plugins* which is still
   active and compiles nicely.
-  Added Daily Color option to NEMS SST for
   background. Each day's color is extracted automatically from the
   color pallet of that day's daily image.
-  Activated I2C on Raspberry Pi build to allow
   piWatcher compatibility. Added final timers to piWatcher script.
-  NEMS Linux 1.5 for Raspberry Pi released to
   public (Build 6).
-  *nems-info ip* will now output 127.0.0.1 instead
   of NULL if no IP address is found on a network controller. Fixes MOTD
   on local logins where a network connection is non-existent.
-  Patched PHP 7.3 and PHP 7.2 configs to allow
   larger background image uploads in NEMS SST.

March 2019

-  NEMS Linux 1.5 Virtual Appliance OVA and VHD Build 1
   released to Patrons for early testing.
-  Connected TV screen improved to include NEMS state
   information. Colors softened for normal state, and will turn red in
   event of CRITICAL state.
-  When uploading a custom background image, the default
   color is then selected from the upload and applied to the browser
   theme. This gives a nice consistency between uploaded image and theme
   colors. Note: If then changing to Custom Color, the color will be
   selected by default.
-  Leaving SMTP username blank in NEMS SST now disables
   SMTP authentication, as requested by dr_patso on Discord (to
   accommodate Office 365 relay).
-  Treat thermals as floating point instead of string in
   thermal logger `as per nix-7`_.
-  Forked *monitoring-plugins* and created new
   installer in *nems-admin* to fix some of the issues with the check
   commands.
-  Rollout a newly compiled version of NEMS WMIC to
   systems who are missing it. This update takes a long time and so will
   lead to a new build for all platforms.
-  Added support for MS Teams webhooks `as per
   stealth81`_.
-  Added support for Slack webhooks.
-  Install PostgreSQL development libraries for
   check_psql and OpenSSL, and recompile all Nagios plugins. Fixes
   errors in NEMS check commands. PATCH-000001 - requires running *sudo
   nems-upgrade*
-  Bumped check_speedtest-cli.sh to v1.3 and disabled
   pre-allocation of memory. This fixes "MemoryError" on lesser boards
   such as the Raspberry Pi Zero. New version will get installed along
   with PATCH-000001.
-  Added Running/Idle status of NEMS Update and NEMS
   Fixes to connected TV screen.
-  Make NEMS branding persistent in Cockpit after an
   update.
-  Cleaned up some bloat in NEMS Migrator's data for
   NEMS 1.5 (backup copies of the MySQL database).
-  Connected TV display now reports if the filesystem
   is still being resized on first boot. NEMS Quickfix now waits 90
   seconds from boot to begin (in case filesystem is being resized).
   PATCH-000002
-  Added *glances* to NEMS 1.5 `as per RSABear`_.
-  Switch network interface management to
   NetworkManager, enabling static IP configuration within the Cockpit
   interface. PATCH-000003
-  Raspberry Pi Build 7 released. This introduces the
   new networking system to Raspberry Pi users, as well as the improved
   check commands and better performance on lesser boards.
-  Added CPU temperature to connected TV display. Also
   fixed a math error which fixes the connected TV's ability to show if
   a new version of NEMS is available.
-  PINE64 A64/A64+ Build 1 released to Patrons. In
   addition to everything that NEMS Linux 1.5 is, this build introduces
   a new kernel which addresses a known issue exists that was previously
   affecting <em>some</em> A64+ boards. If affected, the system clock
   would jump 99 years into the future—which subsequently impacted many
   of the NEMS services.
-  PINE64 Rock64 Build 1 released to Patrons.
-  If sysbench is not available, do not try to run
   benchmarks.
-  Notate PATCH-000002 on Rock64 boards retroactively
   since the Build 1 version of the file resize script does not log the
   success.
-  Added *rootdev* and *rootpart* to `nems-info`_.
-  New img build workflow created, including new `Base
   Images`_. Theoretically img files should be a bit smaller here
   forward (due to zerofill) and should be more consistent (less chance
   for corrupt build img files).
-  After `reporting`_ *sysbench* missing Buster
   binaries to the developer, it was added. Integrated the Buster
   installation into NEMS Benchmark since the Debian repositories are
   thus far also missing the package. System will check upstream first,
   and if not available, will install from developer repository.
-  PINE64 A64/A64+ Build 1 released to public.
-  PINE64 Rock64 Build 2 released to patrons and
   public. Fixes bad image creation of Build 1 causing it not to boot.
   Also integrates PATCH-000002.
-  *nems-quickfix* (and therefore a reboot) now removes
   NEMS NConf generator lock file if it exists. It can get left behind
   in certain circumstances, which would cause NConf to say "Someone
   else is already generating the configuration."
-  PATCH-000002 now gets automatically logged to all
   boards if the main partition is sized greater than 9 GB. This ensures
   platforms such as the virtual appliance and the Rock64 transition to
   a ready state if the patch is not logged already but the partition is
   indeed resized.
-  If sysbench is not found in the developer's
   repository, remove the repository and update apt before cancelling
   the benchmark. See `Issue 298`_.
-  Added *speedtest* to `nems-info`_.
-  NEMS will now automatically detect the nearest
   Internet speedtest server and use it by default. May be overridden by
   ARG if option changed in NEMS SST.
-  Added *rootfulldev* to `nems-info`_.
-  Improved thermal detection for cross-device
   compatibility. Also updated *nems-info temperature* to output
   realtime thermal data rather than 15 minutes log.
-  Added *fileage* to `nems-info`_.
-  Improved connected TV screen to now show how long
   updates/fixes have been running.
-  `nems-info`_ *hosts* & *services* were showing one
   more than actual true count. This was due to a previous update to the
   livestatus socket which results in it outputting a header line, which
   was being counted as a result. Simply subtracted 1 to counteract. As
   reported by UltimateBugHunter.
-  PINE64 A64-LTS/SOPine Build 1 patron pre-release.
-  Retroactively enable rc.local service on boards
   where it is not enabled by default (eg., Rock64). Thanks to
   UltimateBugHunter for putting me onto the problem, having noticed the
   connected TV was going to sleep after 10 minutes (even though
   rc.local was set to disable TV sleeping).
-  Fixed issue with temperature output on connected TV
   which would cause math errors when converting from Celsius to
   Fahrenheit.
-  ODROID-N2 Build 1 released to patrons.

April 2019

-  NanoPi M4 Build 1 released to patrons.
-  PINE64 A64-LTS Build 1 released to public.
-  Change the warning message if NEMS can't connect to
   github, as pointed out by ITManLT.
-  ODROID-XU4 Build 4 released. Keeping in mind the XU4
   platform was the first public release of NEMS 1.5, this is a
   significant upgrade. This moves XU4 from Stretch to Buster and adds
   all the new check command scripts, as well as all updates that have
   been released since the first NEMS Linux 1.5 release.
-  Virtual Appliance Build 2 (OVA, VHD, QCOW2) released
   to Patrons. This build was developed on an ESXi development laptop
   donated by bhammy187. Build 2 should be much easier to import into
   any hypervisor, making it significantly more portable than Build 1.
-  Added error handling to thermal sensor check to
   report UNKNOWN if the sensor doesn't exist, as would be the case with
   a Virtual Appliance.
-  New universal filesystem resizer automatically
   detects the root partition and resizes it. Will continue to adapt to
   eventually deprecate the separate resizer scripts for each platform.
-  Add error handling to nems_sendmail_host and
   nems_sendmail_service to accommodate inability to write to Nagios log
   if user runs *nems-mailtest* as a non-root user. As reported by
   ITManLT.
-  Fix issue where disabling SMTP TLS in NEMS SST would
   always revert to enabled. Reported by ITManLT and confirmed by
   UltimateBugHunter-NitPicker.
-  ASUS Tinker Board / S Build 1 released to Patrons.
-  ODROID-C2 Build 1 released to patrons.
-  ODROID-N2 Build 1 and ODROID-C2 Build 1 released to
   public.
-  RockPro64 Build 1 released to public.
-  Minor verbiage adjustment re. Speedtest Server in
   NEMS SST.
-  Compile sysbench if not exist, improve compatibility
   with various versions (ie., detect which switches are accepted for
   cli variables).
-  Fix spelling of Orange Pi (DietPi had spelled it
   OrangePi).
-  NEMS Linux 1.5 Build 1 for NanoPi M4 and Orange Pi
   Zero released to public.
-  Update weekly benchmark to save transient data in a
   secure tmp folder.
-  Re-order events in weekly benchmark to ensure the
   compiler runs even if a benchmark is not scheduled (so the needed
   software is ready to go).
-  Lay groundwork to add 7zip benchmarks to weekly
   benchmark.

May 2019

-  NEMS Linux 1.5 Build 1 for NanoPi NEO Plus2 released to
   Patrons.
-  Add distinction between 512 MB and 1 GB version of the
   NanoPi NEO Plus2.
-  Added 7zip benchmark to weekly benchmarks.
-  Fixed glitch in NanoPi NEO Plus2 hardware ID generator
   and blocked null HWID's after detecting that one Virtual Appliance
   user had booted a VM with no MAC address.
-  Make weekly benchmark data readable by all, but only
   writable by root.
-  Add *benchmark 7z* option to *nems-info*.
-  Change *nems-info online* to use wget instead of ping.
   As pointed out by ITManLT, some networks block ping, causing NEMS to
   think it has no Internet connectivity (and therefore updates do not
   run).
-  Monitorix now loads all graphs dynamically, and
   displays all available graphs (not just the ones I manually selected
   back in NEMS 1.2).
-  Fix PHP notice for undefined variable when manually
   running a *nems-benchmark*.
-  Finish moving *nems-benchmark* over to 7-Zip benchmarks
   rather than sysbench, and completely remove sysbench from the normal
   benchmark process. It will be re-added later as a supplement, but
   will not be used for NEMS scoring.
-  If any of the sysbench benchmarks don't exist, output a
   0 instead of a error in *nems-info*.
-  Roll out a patch that removes some of the residual
   Armbian settings from early base images. /var/log was being loaded
   into zram instead of stored on disk, resulting in /var/log becoming
   full. This patch fixes that and ensures log files are stored on disk.
   Only affects early releases (such as Build 1 for TinkerBoard and
   NanoPi M4). Pointed out `by Marshman`_.
-  NEMS Linux 1.5 Build 2 for Tinker Board / S released to
   public.
-  NEMS Linux 1.5 Build 2 for ODROID-N2 released,
   integrating `Meverics' patch`_ which resolves the networking /
   slowness / inability to boot issues found on some ODROID-N2 boards.
   Big thanks to UltimateBugHunter-NitPicker for initially reporting
   this issue.
-  NEMS Linux 1.5 Virtual Appliance (OVA) Build 3
   released. This build reduces the ESXi Virtual Hardware Version from
   14 to 7, meaning NEMS Linux may now be deployed on older versions of
   ESXi. No need to re-release VMDK or QCOW2 for Build 3 since the
   update only affects OVA.
   
June 2019

-  Removed unneeded virtual hardware from OVA appliance.
-  Restructure the Virtual Appliance OVA for
   compatibility with ESXi 5.5+.
-  NEMS Linux 1.5 Virtual Appliance (OVA) Build 4
   released. This build resolves the error "The OVF package is invalid
   and cannot be deployed" on older versions of ESXi. The cause of the
   issue was because older versions do not support the SHA256 hashing
   algorithm. Build 4 is identical to Build 3 in every way except the
   Cryptographic Hash Algorithm has been switched from SHA256 to SHA1,
   making it compatible with older ESXi servers.
-  Upgraded speedtest from 1.0.6 to 2.1.1.
-  Added initial Raspberry Pi 4 support.
-  Change the way various Raspberry Pi models are
   displayed. Eg., *Raspberry Pi 3* now, instead of previous *Raspberry
   Pi 3 Model B*. *Raspberry Pi 3 B+* now instead of previous *Raspberry
   Pi 3 Model B+*.
-  Raspberry Pi Build 8 released. Introduces
   out-of-the-box support for Raspberry Pi 4 and includes all patches
   that were issued since Build 7 was released 3 months ago.
-  Raspberry Pi boards were previously reported as 'RPi'
   by the hardware description script. I didn't like this, so I changed
   it. Where a board previously listed itself as 'RPi 3 B+' it will now
   say 'Raspberry Pi 3 B+', for example.
-  Moved *monit* to custom build rather than pulling
   from apt repository. Package is missing from some Debian Buster
   builds. This also ensures we have the latest version at time of
   build.
   
July 2019

-  Added new command *nems-install* which will install
   NEMS Linux on eMMC on the Khadas VIM3. In future versions, it may be
   expanded to support other boards if required.
-  Khadas VIM3 Build 1 released to Patrons.
-  Buster is now stable. Update releaseinfo, and do this
   automatically in future.
-  Remove check_speedtest's reliance on a server ID.
   Latest version supports automatic detection on launch, and will
   automatically roll to next available server in line if server fails
   to respond. Much better than single point of failure, which has been
   causing false notifications the past few days. Thanks to mydogboris
   for reporting this.
-  A patch to enable disabled rc.local that was
   previously released had been broken due to a renamed build script.
   Fixed.
-  NEMS SST now features a tab "TV Dashboard". Password
   setting for NEMS TV Dashboard has been moved to this tab (was
   previously under *Optional Services*), and two new features have been
   added: 24 hour clock formatting, ability to display faults
   immediately rather than waiting for the service to enter a
   notification state. Some users were confused by the default, so this
   allows them to change when they are notified.
-  In NEMS SST, move NEMS Migrator to the NEMS Cloud
   Services tab.
-  Begin encrypting NEMS State data with personal
   encryption/decryption password for NEMS Cloud Services users in
   preparation for the coming NEMS Cloud Services Dashboard.
-  NEMS Cloud Services master NEMS Server login
   complete.
-  NEMS Cloud Services now receives NEMS GPIO Extender
   data from subscribed devices. This will allow NEMS Warning Light or
   GPIO Extender Clients to be placed anywhere in the world, and will
   also allow a single NEMS Warning Light to display the state of
   multiple NEMS Servers.
-  NEMS Cloud Services Dashboard now displays the master
   NEMS Server alias, CheckIn setting and Host/Service state.
-  NEMS Cloud Services Dashboard now updates the state
   data automatically. This was a bit more complex than a standard ajax
   call due to the encrypted state of the data.
-  Added tooltips to Host/Service icon on NEMS Cloud
   Services Dashboard which shows the count of each state.
-  Added *nems-info*\ **cloudauthcache** option which
   loads the current NEMS Cloud Services authorization status from cache
   rather than a live connection (significantly faster for quick
   checks).
-  NEMS Cloud Services Dashboard has been added to the
   "Reporting" menu on all NEMS servers which are connected to the
   service.
-  Added NEMS Platform and Version to NEMS Cloud
   Services Dashboard.
-  Added credential error handling to NEMS Cloud
   Services parent server login. Now, an easy to understand error
   message will be given if you enter invalid credentials, rather than
   just receiving a blank page.
-  Moved NEMS TV Dashboards' livestatus connector to a
   new folder "connectors" to pave the way for new dashboard connectors.
-  NEMS TV Dashboard has been removed from *nems-www*
   and is now its own repository called *nems-tv*. This is to allow me
   to add NEMS TV Dashboard to NEMS Cloud Services without needing to
   build a second (redundant) version. It also means NEMS Cloud
   Services' version will exactly mirror the features of the local copy.
-  Add *livestatus* to `nems-info`_.
-  Add check to ensure *nems-tv* is enabled, and if not,
   enable it. Thanks to ITmanLT for pointing out the issue.
-  NEMS TV Dashboard added to `NEMS Cloud Services`_.
-  Improve the output of the clock on NEMS TV Dashboard.
-  Sync NEMS TV Dashboard's local clock setting to NEMS
   Cloud Services. Now the clock output format will match your local
   settings (ie., 12/24h format, whether to show am/pm).
-  NEMS TV Dashboard in NEMS Cloud Services now shows
   the alias of the reporting NEMS Server. This is in preparation for
   the coming reconciliation of multiple connected NEMS Servers on a
   single NCS TV Dashboard.
-  Added support for `TEMPer`_ hardware.
-  Added exit codes to check_temper.

August 2019

-  Added UNKNOWN state to check_temper. If TEMPer
   device is disconnected, will now report UNKNOWN instead of 0°.
-  *check_temper* now detects automatically whether the
   user is entering their ARG temperatures in C or F and acts
   accordingly.
-  Major rework of NRPE. NEMS Linux no longer uses the
   package maintainer's version of NRPE. A new installer has also been
   provided for Debian hosts to ease the deployment process. Please see
   `Check Commands: check_nrpe`_ which details what is required.
-  Added `custom_check_mem`_ checkcommand and
   corresponding NRPE advanced service, called *Check Memory NRPE*.
-  `Telegram notification configuration`_ has been
   made more clear in `NEMS SST`_, and the documentation has been
   rewritten to match.
-  `Telegram notification script`_ reworked to remove
   the 'g' from Chat ID automatically, making it a bit easier to
   understand input.
-  Fixed error on NEMS Cloud Services Dashboard where
   the tooltip() function was not loaded before it was called.
-  Begin building a means of NEMS Cloud Services' TV
   Dashboard to detect and display if the NEMS Server is not online (via
   NEMS CheckIn). Also, the server list will now highlight down NEMS
   Servers red.
-  NEMS Migrator Restore now breaks apart the
   checkcommands file from the NEMS backup and attempts to import each
   command individually. This has the effect of skipping (Aborting)
   import of checkcommands that already exist in the default NEMS NConf
   database while allowing the user-created checkcommands to be
   imported. Thanks to Jon Backhaus for pointing out the issue.
-  NEMS TV Dashboard has a setting in NEMS SST that
   allows you to change the notifications to immediately display, rather
   than honoring the notifications settings in NEMS NConf. This setting
   now also impacts the results of *nems-info*\ **state** and NEMS Cloud
   Services' TV Dashboard.
-  Added *nems-info*\ **state all** Output the state
   information of all NEMS hosts and services to JSON format, regardless
   of state.
-  NEMS Server State Report added to NEMS Cloud
   Services. Now you can see the state of all your hosts/services
   directly from the NEMS Cloud Services Dashboard.
-  NEMS Linux 1.5 AMI Build 1 for Amazon Web Services
   released.
   
September 2019

-  The development version of NEMS Linux for the
   ODROID-C1+ was losing its heartbeat following filesystem resize, so I
   got looking deeper at the ODROID resize stage scripts. In doing so, I
   found a typo in the \*start\* variable creation of stage1 which
   resulted in the first partition starting at the first sector of the
   disk rather than the needed sector 8192 on the ODROID-C1+. This bug
   has been fixed, and the ODROID-C1+ development build is working.
-  NEMS Linux 1.5 for ODROID-C0/C1/C1+ Build 1
   released.
-  Added *nems-info*\ **frequency** to display the
   *current* CPU operating frequency.
-  In *nems-init* the *mysqld* daemon is forcibly
   killed if stopping fails (as it tends to do on Docker). This in turn
   causes an error on platforms where systemd is able to stop the
   process: can't kill a task that isn't running. Add a check to see if
   *mysqld* is running before attempting to kill it.
-  `Push Notifications Using Telegram`_ now includes
   an emoji to help distinguish the state.
-  Improve *nems-fs-resize* to support drives that
   are not mmcblk0 type. Now, the script can be used to resize the
   Virtual Appliance disk, for example.
-  Re-order the output of Telegram notifications to
   make them easier to see critical information at a glance. Now, the
   NEMS Server's alias and the timestamp are listed first, followed by
   the notification information.
-  Check for the existence of rc.local before
   patching it in nems-update fixes. This is in particular for Docker
   (which doesn't use rc.local) to prevent [harmless] errors during
   update.
-  Add SCSI dev assignment detection to
   *nems-info*\ **rootfulldev**\ */*\ **rootpart**\ */*\ **rootdev**.
   This fixes the feature on non-MMC storage platforms, such as the
   Virtual Appliance.
-  Fixed a previously unnoticed bug in Telegram
   *service* notifications where the Service output was displaying the
   datestamp rather than the output.
-  Added rich-text markdown to Telegram host and
   service notifications. Now, the layout looks really good (not just
   plain text).
-  Added `NEMS Linux Vendor Branding`_. Now, you can
   add your own logo to the NEMS Dashboard.
-  Added the vendor logo (if applicable) to the init
   screen.
-  Remove Raspberry Pi logo from boot screen.
-  NEMS Linux 1.5 Build 2 for ODROID-C2 released.
-  Updated migrator databases include the
   recommended settings for `check_temper`_ and `custom_check_mem`_, no
   longer requiring users to manually add them on new deployments.
-  Version increased to 1.5.1. No further builds of
   1.5 will be created.
-  Add *nems-info*\ **perfdata_cutoff** which shows
   the cutoff (in days) for perfdata retention.
-  NEMS SST now has a "Maintenance" section
   featuring a perfdata cleanup schedule. This allows users to select to
   remove old perfdata to avoid a bloated perfdata.log file. As
   requested by rkadmin, whose file had reached 15GB in size. By
   default, this feature is disabled and perfdata is kept indefinitely
   if enabled in NEMS NConf.
-  NEMS Cloud Services will now re-route you to the
   Dashboard if you have an active session. Active sessions will remain
   active for 24 hours. As `requested by Premium`_.
-  Removed the perfdata tweaks as they only bandaid
   the more crucial problem: a misconfigured Nagios conf. Will later add
   a feature to tweak nagios.cfg settings, but for now those who choose
   to hack their cfg files directly will probably break things.
-  NEMS Linux 1.5.1 Build 1 for Raspberry Pi went
   into private testing.
-  NEMS Cloud Services sessions now remain active
   for 7 days, allowing you to open NEMS Cloud Services features in your
   browser without needing to login (until you click Logout).
-  *nems-info*\ **frequency** now reports the
   average frequency across all cores, rather than the frequency of the
   first core. Thanks to Bo from ameriDroid for pointing out this
   inconsistency.
-  The build process now clears bash history
   correctly so on first boot, users don't have the development history.
-  NEMS Linux 1.5.1 Build 1 for ODROID-C2 went into
   private testing.
-  NEMS Migrator Off Site Backup calendar data had
   no error handling, so if the server didn't respond during the daily
   check-in, the data would still be overwritten, but with invalid JSON
   data. Added a JSON parser to detect if the server's response is valid
   JSON before clobbering the data file.
-  Fix the name of ODROID-C2.
-  NEMS Linux 1.5.1 for Raspberry Pi and ODROID-C2
   released.
-  NEMS Linux 1.5.1 for ODROID-XU4 released.

October 2019

-  *nems-info*\ **nic** and *nems-info*\ **online**
   now use nemslinux.com instead of google.com for their tests. Also,
   results are cached for one minute, reducing the number of requests
   while still remaining accurate to the minute. As requested by Joerg
   Hoffmann.
   
November 2019

-  Removed smooth scrolling from *nems-www* as it
   causes jerky behavior in modern versions of Chrome, resulting in
   console error, "Unable to preventDefault inside passive event
   listener due to target being treated as passive."
-  Account for the fact that some users may have
   passwords in their password when restoring from a NEMS Migrator
   backup set. Before now, a password in the password would result in a
   null password.
   
December 2019

-  The current NEMS version is now platform
   independent, meaning an ODROID-XU4 won't report a new version just
   because a new version was released for Raspberry Pi (for example). As
   per `Issue 1`_ on NEMS Migrator.
-  Define the platform distinction in NEMS Server
   Overview with regards to currently available version. Reduce calls to
   api by 1/3 (performance improvement) for Platform Name.
-  If user is already a Patron, remove the "Become a
   Patron" button.

January 2020

-  PixelSlayer Bob pointed out that 9590 was missing
   from monit on NEMS 1.5.1. Investigated and it turns out the monit
   service installers were patched into NEMS Linux during 1.4, but never
   moved to the 1.5 branch. Fixed.
-  If a user has the "NEMS is not initialized" page
   open in their browser and completes a nems-init process, the browser
   will now automatically redirect to the NEMS Dashboard.

February 2020

-  Upgraded 1.5 branch to check_temper from 1.6
   branch and improved thresholds for detection of C vs F temperatures.
   This brings in a few of the important check_temper fixes and
   improvements from NEMS 1.6 to users of NEMS Linux 1.5. Thanks to
   *tripled* for pointing out the issue with certain temperature
   thresholds.
-  Fix footer on NEMS TV Dashboard so it doesn't
   jump up after 60 seconds due to the speedtest update that was added
   for 1.6. Reported by ITManLT.

April 2020

-  Add *www-data* to the forbidden usernames list. Fix
   nems-info so www-data user doesn't attempt to create a NEMS cache
   folder.
-  *nems-init* now asks if you'd like to proceed if it
   detects your NEMS Server is already initialized.
-  Improve the verbosity of error messages when
   restoring a NEMS Migrator Off Site Backup.

May 2020

-  Significant overhaul of the NRPE installer to improve
   compatibility with client systems (especially Ubuntu / Linux Mint).
   Deals with `Issue 3`_ plus other undocumented issues.
-  Migrated Nagios misc data folder to 1.6 branch in
   nems-migrator.
-  Create and enable (and document) check_cpu_temp in
   `Check Commands: check_nrpe`_ which allows monitoring remote system
   CPU temperatures using lm-sensors on the remote host. A feature
   request by *tripled*.
-  Add Sysfs thermal data to *check_cpu_temp* if
   available, and fallback on it if *lm-sensors* isn't installed. Add
   unknown state if thermal data cannot be obtained by either of these
   two methods.
-  Fixed the apt update which occurred during a NEMS
   Update task: On Raspberry Pi it requires --allow-releaseinfo-change,
   but this was breaking the update on some other platforms. So only use
   this argument on RPi-based NEMS Servers.
-  Add the apt key signature for the sury repository,
   which hosts PHP for some earlier builds of NEMS Linux.
-  Released NagiosTV (called NEMS Tactical Overview on
   NEMS Linux) in advance to NEMS Linux 1.5 users. It was originally
   slated to wait until the NEMS Linux 1.6 release, but that is being
   held up by Adagios at the moment, so I thought it would be nice to
   push out a little gift to the users as thanks for their patience.
-  Upgraded NagiosTV to 0.5.3. Adapt CSS overrides to
   allow use of NEMS wallpaper and other stylistic enhancements.
-  Security improvement: Moved several nems-scripts
   temporary shell scripts out of /tmp.
-  Ensure check commands are replaced should NRPE upgrade
   be run on a NEMS Server.
-  Create Credit Roll Easter Egg.
-  Improve the audio timing and add layout of Credit Roll
   Easter Egg.
-  Add IP Address to all screens of bootscreen.
-  Several NEMS NConf improvements / fixes (not
   retroactive on already initialized NEMS Servers). Examples: Add
   *check_temper_temp* and *check_temper_hum* temperature and humidity
   checks, fix *custom_check_mem*.
-  Change sample SBC CPU temperature service check to
   recent NRPE version and move to Advanced Services to improve
   understanding for users and make it easier to apply the service to
   other hosts.
-  Add *Room Temperature* and *Room Humidity* sample
   services to NEMS Server. If user has a `TEMPer`_ device connected,
   results will be provided.
-  Create udisks2 modules directory to prevent deceptive
   "error" in Cockpit logs. As reported by UltimateBugHunter-NitPicker
   and listed in `Cockpit Issue 12412`_.

June 2020

-  NEMS Linux 1.5.2 released for Raspberry Pi. Brings
   together all updates and patches since 1.5.1, and adds support for
   the new 8GB Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. Thanks to
   UltimateBugHunter-NitPicker for beta testing the initial build for me
   as my 8GB Raspberry Pi has still not arrived here in Canada.
-  NEMS Linux for Docker moved to 1.5.2 branch to
   expedite release.
-  Grant non-root access to TEMPer devices on USB after a
   reboot, and periodically.
-  Make text darker in NEMS SST.
-  Add error handling in case either the thermal or
   humidity sensor are not detected on a TEMPer device (as is the case
   with a unit which only has one or the other, for example). As
   reported by JonBackhaus.
-  Upgrade NagVis to 1.9.20, which resolves an issue with
   user creation as pointed out by jnrhome. Pushed out through daily
   patches to all NEMS Servers.
-  Pipe error output from temper.py to null so it doesn't
   interfere with the response of the script when TEMPer is not getting
   enough power.
-  Fix incorrect NConf fk_id_item assignment for NEMS
   host in `NEMS Migrator Restore`_. This was causing the host-preset's
   check-alive to be assigned incorrectly. Now, generating the Nagios
   config will work fine after *nems-restore*. Big thanks to
   UltimateBugHunter-NitPicker not only for bringing the issue to my
   attention, but for granting me remote access to his NEMS Server to
   allow me to replicate and ultimately fix this.
-  Install WMIC and the insert script for NagiosGraph
   which were missing in 1.5.2 and any systems which ran the recent NRPE
   upgrade. As pointed out by UltimateBugHunter-NitPicker.
-  Add watchdog daemon and safe shutdown on smart UPS
   battery depleted for `PiVoyager`_ pHat.
-  Add Multi Router Traffic Grapher (MRTG) `as requested
   by mydogboris`_.
-  Add logging to *nems-quickfix* in case it appears
   hung. Log can be tailed at /var/log/nems/nems-quickfix.log
-  Added logrotate `as per baggins`_.
-  Improve handling of database initialization.
-  Do not attempt to configure non-existent SSH service
   on Docker when initializing.
-  Change *nems-update* to only attempt installation of
   SURY GPG key if it is missing (was expired on some older NEMS Servers
   as it appears they're only valid for 2 years). Current key expires
   March 2021.
-  PiVoyager now active on all NEMS Servers (will not do
   anything if hardware doesn't exist).
-  Abort benchmark if watchdog (PiVoyager or PiWatcher)
   are connected. The high load of the benchmark can cause the system to
   appear unresponsive for some time, resulting in the watchdog
   believing the board to be hung, which would cause the watchdog to
   power-cycle the NEMS Server.
-  mrtg.sh will now detect the [first] default gateway of
   the current connection and offer it as the IP to use for MRTG. If
   incorrect, user may still enter the router IP manually.
-  If no SNMP data is found on the router, mrtg.sh will
   provide a proper error rather than a "file not found" error.
-  Add DEB/RPM detection when installing NRPE on Linux
   host system. Rudimentary setup of RPM installation in place. Many
   things still don't work on RPM-based hosts, but it's a great start,
   and `047-nrpe`_ will not attempt to run apt-get on CentOS anymore.
-  If, when user runs mrtg.sh, the MRTG Apache
   configuration is not enabled, enable it automatically.
-  Added *mrtgsetup* command (a symlink to mrtg.sh).
-  Added custom trap community support to mrtgsetup.
-  Added MRTG index to https://nems.local/mrtg
-  Improved NEMS Migrator admin component to separate
   1.5 and 1.6 databases in preparation for 1.5.2 compatibility and
   inevitable move to 1.6.
-  Remove git postBuffer (created by nems-admin during
   nems-push procedure) upon nems-update.
-  Stash a change in NEMS Migrator which halted updates
   to Migrator on 1.5.2 (fixes several issues related to this, including
   TEMPer, and ability to update NEMS Migrator). Automatically patches
   all 1.5.2 systems.
-  Add cronjob to automatically set USB permission every
   minute if device connected. This makes it so users no longer have to
   reboot after plugging in a TEMPer sensor. Now, it will work
   automatically after no more than 60 seconds.

July 2020

-  NEMS Migrator has been moved to its own tab in NEMS
   SST. It was previously included on the NEMS Cloud Services page,
   which is inappropriate since it can be run locally.
-  NEMS CheckIn Notifications now tell you how long the
   server was down for upon recovery.
-  Fixed *nems-www*'s wallpaper.php to only try to load
   NEMS-specific functions if running on a NEMS Server. Was causing log
   flood on NEMS' public web site.
-  Corrected redundant verbiage on NEMS CheckIn emails.
   "Has been down for 15 minutes *minutes*." Not sure how that never got
   noticed before. 😊
-  New command: *nems-passwd* allows changing the NEMS
   Server admin account password without having to re-initialize NEMS
   Linux. As requested by geek-dom and JJ Dubya J.
-  If TEMPer is connected but lacks a dev assignment,
   abort loop. This can occur if the pass-through on a Virtual Machine
   is botched. Removing the virtual device and re-connecting it should
   fix, but until that time, we don't want the script to hang.

August 2020

-  NEMS Linux now stores a file *NEMS_SERVER.txt* in
   the Windows-readable section of your NEMS storage medium (eg., SD
   card) which contains some information about your NEMS Server (NEMS
   Version, Platform, HWID, Alias). This will make it easier for users
   to determine which board a SD card came out of should they need to,
   `as per Marshman`_, by simply plugging the card into their computer.
-  Added JSON output switch to `nems-mailtest`_ and
   *nems_sendmail_service* in preparation for integration with NEMS SST.
-  NEMS Linux 1.5.2 for PINE64 A64/A64+ released as
   per `this thread`_.
-  Migrate all system emails (ie., NEMS CheckIn, Forum
   Notifications, etc.) to Amazon SES and enable DKIM. Maximize
   reliability of notification emails from NEMS Cloud Services and
   reduce being falsely identified as spam.
-  Add color to the warning label when user tries to
   initialize a NEMS Server that has already been initialized (to make
   it stand out better).

September 2020

-  Make 500-temper not log to cur file, which was
   causing uninitialized NEMS Servers to say 'compiling' rather than
   'not initialized'.
-  Sync all files from user's home folder when
   initializing or re-initializing. While this obviously prevents any
   accidental data loss, this is particularly to ensure SSH key trust
   relationships are not lost if a user re-initializes a NEMS Server on
   AWS.
-  Yay community! We surpassed 100 YouTube
   subscribers on the NEMS Linux channel, so that means we qualify for a
   vanity URL. I updated *nems-www* footer link to reflect this change.
-  Adjust webhook notifications to recognize
   Discord's change in URL for webhooks. Old URLs contained
   discordapp.com as the domain. New ones are at discord.com, so NEMS
   was rejecting them for an invalid domain name. Thanks to `Amheus for
   bringing this to my attention`_.
-  Omzlo Warninglights pHAT support enabled.
-  Enabled the watchdog feature of the Omzlo
   Warninglights pHAT.

October 2020

-  Add external sensor support to TEMPer checks, and
   set as default. If an external sensor exists, it will be used. If
   not, the internal sensor will be used. Also added output
   *temp_location* and *hum_location* to *nems-info temper* to show
   which sensor is being used. As `pointed out by Toasteh\_`_.

2021

While development has entirely shifted to NEMS Linux 1.6, the following
issues have been addressed in 2021:

-  Windows update broke `wmic` causing NEMS to no longer be able to
   authenticate to those updated machines. As this is fixed in NEMS
   Linux 1.6, I also backported the patch to NEMS Linux 1.5.x on all
   platforms. Patch # 000016. To obtain the patch, run `sudo nems-upgrade`
-  Backport speedtest from NEMS Linux 1.6 after Ookla changed licensing.
-  NEMS Update will now allow a repository update even after Debian moves
   the old repository.
-  Cockpit branding broke in 1.6 after assets moved in NEMS-Migrator. Fixed.
-  Backport of NagiosTV broken in 1.5.x after config moved in NEMS Migrator
   for 1.6. Fixed.
