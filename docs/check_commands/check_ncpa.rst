Check Command: check_ncpa
=========================

Check Command version 1.2.3 added 1.6.

This plugin works with NCPA 2+ and is backwards compatible with NCPA 1.

I've included a couple sample check commands in NEMS Linux 1.6 to get you started:

check_ncpa_mem
Check the memory usage of a system.

check_ncpa_processes
Check number of running processes on a system.
