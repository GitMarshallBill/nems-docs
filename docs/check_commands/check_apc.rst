Check Command: check_apc
========================

APC UPS's use SNMPv1. You can configure SNMP for your UPS from its web
interface or within your UPS's configuration software client.

*check_apc*Â provides performance data and range monitoring for a wide
series of data and a large number of APC UPS's, including Symmetra and
SmartUPS models.

This check command requires NEMS Linux 1.6+.

check_apc Available Command Arguments
-------------------------------------

- ``id`` - Return the UPS model name (e.g. 'APC Smart-UPS 600') and interlan info
  about Firmware, CPU S/N and manufacturing date
- ``bat_status`` - Return the status of the UPS batteries
- ``bat_capacity`` - Return the remaining battery capacity expressed in percent of full
  capacity
- ``bat_temp`` - Return the current internal UPS temperature expressed in Celsius
- | ``bat_run_remaining`` - Return the UPS battery run time remaining before battery exhaustion
  | **Note:** thresholds must be expressed in minutes
- ``bat_replace`` - Return whether the UPS batteries need replacing
- ``bat_num_batt`` - Return the number of external battery packs connected to the UPS
- ``bat_num_bad_batt`` - Return the number of external battery packs connected to the UPS that
  are defective
- | ``bat_act_volt`` - Return the actual battery bus voltage in Volts
  | **Note:** thresholds must be expressed in range as nearest values. ex:
  | normal=220, warning=215:225, critical=210:230
  | Additionally, the checks will look for Nominal Voltage (as returned
  | by the UPS), and exit as CRITICAL if Actual Voltage is LOWER or Equal
- ``power_modules`` - Return the status of the Power Modules
- ``in_phase`` - Return the current AC input phase
- | ``in_volt`` - Return the current utility line voltage in VAC
  | **Note** thresholds must be expressed in range as nearest values. ex:
  | normal=220, warning=215:225, critical=210:230
- | ``in_freq`` - Return the current input frequency to the UPS system in Hz
  | **Note:** thresholds must be expressed in range as nearest values. ex:
  | normal=50, warning=45:55, critical=40:60
- ``out_status`` - Return the current state of the UPS
- ``out_phase`` - Return the current output phase
- | ``out_volt`` - Return the output voltage of the UPS system in VAC
  | **Note:** thresholds must be expressed in range as nearest values. ex:
  | normal=220, warning=215:225, critical=210:230
- | ``out_freq`` - Return the current output frequency of the UPS system in Hz
  | **Note:** thresholds must be expressed in range as nearest values. ex:
  | normal=50, warning=45:55, critical=40:60
- ``out_load`` - Return the current UPS load expressed in percent of rated capacity
- ``out_current`` - Return the current in amperes drawn by the load on the UPS
- ``comm_status`` - Return the status of agent's communication with UPS.

If no command is supplied, the script returns OKAY with the UPS model
information.
