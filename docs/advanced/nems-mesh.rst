NEMS Mesh: The Self-Hosted NEMS Cloud
=====================================

NEMS Mesh allows the connection of multiple NEMS Servers together in a pseudo-mesh style self-hosted cloud. This allows sysadmins to place NEMS Servers at client sites but poll and monitor them from one central NEMS Server.
