NEMS Linux Commands: nems-info
==============================

*nems-info* parses and outputs a great deal of useful information about
your NEMS Linux deployment. This data is used by various NEMS Linux
features, but can also be called manually if desired.

*nems-info* does not require root privileges, and can be called from any
folder on your NEMS Linux server.
