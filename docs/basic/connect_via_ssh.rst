Connect to NEMS Server Over SSH
-------------------------------

The first time you connect to your NEMS server you will use the
`nemsadmin <../basic/default_password.html>`__ account.

After you have successfully `initialized NEMS <../gettingstarted/initialization.html>`__,
you will instead use the account you create during that process.

Linux, Microsoft Windows or macOS
