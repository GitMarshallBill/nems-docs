Features: Port 9590
===================

Introduction
------------

Port 9590 is a dummy listener on all NEMS 1.4.1+ servers.

This listener does nothing but reply to TCP requests when it is up. Its
purpose is to provide a safe port to enable and disable while learning
how to use the check
command `check_tcp <../basic/checktcp.html>`__.

Disable 9590
------------

To disable 9590 temporarily, open its process in Monit Service Monitor
and choose “Stop service”. It will however resume normal operation at
next reboot.

To disable 9590 permanently, first stop it with Monit (otherwise Monit
will re-run the service once it detects it is not running). Then, open
an SSH connection to your NEMS server and type:

sudo /usr/sbin/update-rc.d 9590 disable

To see how 9590 works, simply review `the source
code <https://github.com/Cat5TV/nems-scripts/blob/master/9590.sh>`__.
