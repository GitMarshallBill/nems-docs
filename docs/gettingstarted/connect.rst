Connecting to Your NEMS Server
==============================

Now that your NEMS Linux server is up and running, you can access its entire feature set via your web browser. Simply point to ``https://nems.local/`` which should work in most networks out of the box, but if you need to, you can alternatively use the IP address of your NEMS server, which you can find in your router's DHCP leases table, or by connecting a TV directly to your NEMS Server.
