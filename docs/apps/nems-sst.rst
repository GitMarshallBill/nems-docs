NEMS System Settings Tool (SST)
===============================

.. note:: NEMS SST requires NEMS Linux 1.3+

Gone are the days of manually editing your Nagios *resource.cfg* file.

NEMS SST provides a web-based GUI to allow easy configuration of system
settings such as SMTP server settings.

To access NEMS SST, click Configuration→NEMS System Settings Tool.

To login, use your NEMS username and password as configured
during `nems-init <../commands/nems-init.html>`__.

Custom Appearance
------------------

Beginning in NEMS Linux 1.5, NEMS SST features the ability to change the
background on some NEMS screens.

**Background Selection** allows you to select from the following:

-  *Daily Image* (default) - Load a new image every day.
-  *Daily Color* - Load a new background base color every day, based on
   the color pallet of the daily image.
-  *NEMS Legacy* - Classic server room image from NEMS Linux 1.4.
-  *Custom Color* - Choose your own base color to use for the
   background.
-  *Upload Image* - Upload your own preferred wallpaper image.

**Blur Background Selection** allows you to add a blur effect to
background images:

-  *Slight Blur* will add a subtle Gaussian blur to the background
   image.
-  *Medium Blur* will add a more pronounced blur to the background
   image.
-  *Heavy Blur* will blur the background image so heavily that only the
   color scheme of the image is recognizable.
