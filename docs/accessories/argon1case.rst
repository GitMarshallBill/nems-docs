  Argon ONE Case for Raspberry Pi 4

The stylish aluminum alloy body, the combination of both passive and
active cooling, and a power button that safely controls the power state
of your NEMS Server are just a few of the points that make the Argon ONE
case a beautiful choice for your Raspberry Pi 4-based NEMS Server.

The Argon ONE active cooling fan is controlled via I2C, and the fan
speed varies based on how hot the Raspberry Pi SOC is. The power button
on the Argon ONE triggers a safe software shutdown on the Raspberry Pi,
as if you had typed *shutdown now -h*
