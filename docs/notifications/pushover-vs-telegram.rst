Pushover vs. Telegram
=====================

Why Choose One Or The Other?
----------------------------

This is not a comprehensive comparison. But rather, this document serves
to help you select which push app is right for your needs.

Pushover
~~~~~~~~

See: `Notifications Using
Pushover <pushover.html>`__

Pros
^^^^

-  Notifications feature colorization based on status, which helps
   critical alerts stand out.
-  There is a free trial, allowing you to test it before committing to
   buying.
-  You can set up delivery groups so your entire team is able to receive
   the notifications.

Cons
^^^^

-  It costs $4.99 USD to buy the app. Multiply this by the number of
   people in your team who need to receive the notifications.
-  Having paid for the app, you receive 7,500 “free” notifications per
   month. If you exceed this, you must purchase more to continue
   receiving notifications.

Telegram
~~~~~~~~

See: `Push Notifications Using
Telegram <telegram.html>`__

.. _pros-1:

Pros
^^^^

-  Entirely Free. Your whole team can install the app and it will cost
   you nothing. There is no fee to purchase the app, and no subscription
   fees. There are not even any ads.
-  Viewing notifications is not limited to the app: You can open your
   bot in your web browser on your computer to see alerts.
-  You can add team members to the room so they also receive the
   notifications on their device.
-  Rich, easy-to-read notifications. Notices include a relevant emoji
   (eg., exclamation mark in event of problem, checkmark if all is well)
   and clean layout.

Cons

-  It cannot make me a latte.
