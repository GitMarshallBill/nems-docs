.. Warning:: **notify-service-by-pushover** and **notify-host-by-pushover** require NEMS 1.4+

1. Install the `Pushover <https://pushover.net/>`__ app on
   your `iOS <https://pushover.net/clients/ios>`__ or `Android <https://pushover.net/clients/android>`__ Device.
2. `Sign up for an account <https://pushover.net/login>`__, which is
   free to try (perfect for setting up and testing) but when you decide
   to use it indefinitely, there is an in-app purchase of around $5 to
   get the full license.
3. Login to their web site on your computer and `create an
   app <https://pushover.net/apps/build>`__. This will give you the  Key
   you need to add to NEMS SST, along with your USER ID (also provided
   when you login to the web site).
4. Copy and paste your  key and User key into NEMS SST and click “Save”.
5. In NEMS NConf,
   add **notify-service-by-pushover** and **notify-host-by-pushover** to
   your contact(s).
6. Done!
