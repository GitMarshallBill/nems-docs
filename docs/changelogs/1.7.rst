NEMS Linux 1.7 Changelogs
=========================

The NEMS 1.7 release cycle will focus on modernizing the codebase, complete
with a move to 64-bit and Python 3 and venv.

**Key Development Features and Goals:**

-  ARMhf support to be deprecated in favor of AArch64.
-  Python moved to v3 stack due to 2.7 EOL, venv utilized.
-  **Firewall** - NEMS Linux to include `ConfigServer Security &
   Firewall (csf) with Login Failure Daemon (lfd)`_. Internal LAN IP
   addresses are whitelisted by default, but if a user tries to access
   your NEMS server from outside the LAN (ie., if you have your NEMS
   server accessible on the Internet) they will get locked out if they
   try an incorrect password too many times.
-  Add IPMI (freeipmi) if not added already.
-  Upgrade CheckMK livestatus socket to 2.0+.

-  Iperf3 running as daemon.
-  Serial login enabled.
-  livestatus upgraded to 2.1.0p37 (cannot go to 2.2 until Trixie due to GCC+-13 dependency).
-  Nagios Core upgraded and held back to 4.4.14 to ensure optimum stability (4.5.x currently has issues with livestatus segfault).
-  Nagios Mobile UI upgraded to 1.0.3 and then modified to support PHP 8.
-  NEMS API upgraded to support PHP 8.
