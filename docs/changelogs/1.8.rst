NEMS Linux 1.8 Changelogs
=========================

NEMS 1.8 is a future release.

**Key Development Features and Goals:**

-  **Firewall** - NEMS Linux to include `ConfigServer Security &
   Firewall (csf) with Login Failure Daemon (lfd)`_. Internal LAN IP
   addresses are whitelisted by default, but if a user tries to access
   your NEMS server from outside the LAN (ie., if you have your NEMS
   server accessible on the Internet) they will get locked out if they
   try an incorrect password too many times.
-  Add IPMI (freeipmi) if not added already.
-  Begin work on smart home assistant integration: NEMS Skill for Alexa
   and Google Assistant.
