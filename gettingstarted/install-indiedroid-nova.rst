Instructions
------------

Install NEMS Linux to MicroSD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Download the latest version of NEMS Linux from https://nemslinux.com/
* Install the Raspberry Pi Imager from https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
* Click "Choose OS"
* Click "Choose Custom" at the bottom of the list
* Browse to your downloaded copy of NEMS Linux
* Click "Choose Storage"
* Insert your MicroSD card or USB Flash Drive
* Carefully select your MicroSD card or USB Flash Drive
* Click "Write"

First Boot
~~~~~~~~~~

* Connect the MicroSD card or USB Flash Drive containing NEMS Linux to your Indiedroid Nova
* Connect the gigabit Ethernet port of the Indiedroid Nova to your network using an Ethernet cable
* Power on the Indiedroid Nova to boot your NEMS Server
* Wait approximately 5 minutes to perform first-boot operations

During the first-boot operation, the filesystem will be automatically resized to the capacity of your storage and the NEMS Server will reboot.

After the first-boot operations have completed, visit https://nems.local/ in your web browser. If name resolution doesnâ€™t work, try the IP address of your NEMS device instead, which you can find in your router's DHCP leases table, or on a TV connected to your NEMS Server's HDMI port.

  Install to eMMC
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  Now that you are booted into your NEMS Server via the MicroSD card, you may choose to utilize the Indiedroid Nova's built-in eMMC storage (more reliable, faster).
  
  * Open the browser-based terminal in Cockpit or SSH to your NEMS Server.
  * Type `sudo nems-install` and follow the prompts.
